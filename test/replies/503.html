<!-- This file is displayed when there is an internal server error (error 500)
     which happens when apache is running but Tomcat is not.  This is important
     because Tomcat takes several seconds to start being able to handle
     messages.  The idea is that this file displays something not
     so scary (instead of Internal Server Error) and then automatically
     does a refresh in 5 seconds to try to load in the page again.  This
     way the user doesn't have to do anything.  Don't want to do it too
	 often because that would prevent the user from typing in another url.
